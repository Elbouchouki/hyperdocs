**GEIW**, or **Global Entrepreneurship Innovation Week**, is an annual event hosted by [ENSET-M](https://www.enset-media.ac.ma/), during which various activities and contests are held. These include **N7 Eloquence** (a French speaking competition), **Public Speaking**, **Photography**, **Social Entrepreneurship**, **N7 Challenge**, **Ideathon**, and **Hackathon**. As a participant in the Hackathon, which was spread over two days (March 16 and 17, 2023), I can provide my evaluation of this specific contest.

The Hackathon involved groups of 5 volunteer students from different Moroccan schools who worked collaboratively on IT development projects. The theme for this year's Hackathon was **"Blockchain and AI at the Service of Health"**, and our team was tasked with creating a decentralized and secure storage system for patient health data. In addition, we were required to include access control functionality for patients and healthcare professionals, a functionality for sharing health data between healthcare professionals, a functionality for monitoring the patient's health status and the medications they take, and a machine learning algorithm for AI.

Our team opted for a **microservice** solution, which we called a **decentralized** and **distributed** solution, as it combined the distribution of services our application provided with the decentralization of the data in blockchains.

Despite the unfamiliarity, our team worked hard for 24 hours and tried our best to deliver a well-done solution. However, one of the problems I had was the fact that this was my first hackathon, with a team whom I had never worked with before. I was surprised by the technical level of some of our team members and their capacity to complete the tasks assigned to them. This created a major problem for the other team members, as we found ourselves with only 2 or 2.5 out of 5 members working hard on the project, while others did not seem to care much about it. This lack of interest was the major negative experience I had in this hackathon, and it was the number one factor that prevented us from completing the whole project, including not having the frontend.

Despite these challenges, we still managed to deliver a strong backend solution, which helped us secure the <Star /> **second prize** without even having a frontend. Overall, the GEIW Hackathon was a great learning opportunity for me and a chance to work on a challenging project in a short amount of time. I appreciated the chance to work on something new and exciting, and I am grateful and proud of our team's achievements.
