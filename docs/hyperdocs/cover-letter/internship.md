Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineer Internship opportunity that your company is offering. As a software engineering and distributed systems student at ENSET-M, I am eager to apply the skills and knowledge I have acquired to a real-world setting. With a passion for software development, I am confident that I would be an asset to your team.

My name is Elbouchouki Ahmed, and I am a 21-year-old student who is currently pursuing a degree in software engineering and distributed systems. My educational background has given me a strong foundation in programming languages, software development methodologies, and distributed systems. In particular, I have extensive experience with backend technologies, such as NestJS (TypeScript) and Spring Boot (Java), as well as frontend technologies like ReactJS, NextJS, VueJS, and QuasarJS.

I am excited about the prospect of interning with your company and gaining valuable hands-on experience in the software development field. I am available for a two-month internship starting from June 15th, and I believe that my technical skills, coupled with my ability to work collaboratively, would make me an ideal candidate for the position.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute my skills and knowledge to your team.

Sincerely,

Elbouchouki Ahmed
