title: Diversifying Horizons Second Edition

---

The online conference titled **"Diversifying Horizons"** organized by GLSID2 and BDCC2 students was an exciting event that aimed to showcase various career paths and possibilities for engineering students. The conference featured three expert speakers who shared their experience and expertise in different domains, including startups, freelancing, and research studies.

The first speaker, [Ahmed JAAFARI](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmedjaafari/), a Research Manager at AL Akhawayn University, provided valuable insights into the NLP project he is working on, specifically Neural Network Processing of Darija dialect. Despite being in a taxi in Dubai, he managed to give us good information about the difficulties he faced due to Darija being a spoken language and not a written one. His presentation was engaging and informative, and he demonstrated his passion and knowledge for the subject.

I think the idea of using Neural Network Processing for Darija dialect is really interesting and could have some great benefits. It could make communication and information exchange easier in North Africa and other places where Darija is spoken. But, we also have to think about the challenges this project could face. One big issue is that Darija varies a lot across different regions and communities, which might make it difficult to develop a system that can accurately translate and process it. And, there's also a risk that the system could introduce bias and inaccuracies into the translation, which would be a problem. Another thing to consider is that this project could impact the preservation of Darija as a unique cultural and linguistic identity. We don't want a system that standardizes Darija too much and loses its special qualities. So, I think it's important to approach this project carefully and consider all the challenges and implications involved.

The second speaker, [Sofia EL BAHJA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophia-el-bahja/), an Entrepreneur and Consultant in Social Innovation, spoke about how she managed to work on her soft skills and social innovation while still studying. She shared her experience about the path she took after graduating and provided valuable tips and tricks to achieve success in social innovation.

From what I gathered from Sofia's speech, it seems that developing strong soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and leadership can be highly beneficial for me as a software engineering student. These skills can help me work well in a team environment, express my ideas clearly to others, and lead projects to successful completion. Additionally, I found it fascinating that by combining my technical skills with social innovation, I could potentially come up with creative solutions to complex problems and make a positive impact on society. It's likely that having these skills would also give me an edge in the job market, as employers often seek candidates who possess both technical and soft skills, as well as innovative thinking abilities.

Lastly, [Ayman LAFAZ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayman-lafaz/), an Ensias Student and a Datascience freelancer, talked about his journey in freelancing while studying at the same time. He shared his experience on how he started freelancing and how he upgraded his profile, along with some key success factors in freelancing, such as how to start and what to do and what not to do. His presentation was insightful and informative, and he demonstrated his expertise in the field.

So from what I understood from Ayman's speech, he talked about his journey in freelancing while studying at the same time. He shared some key success factors in freelancing, like how to start and what to do and what not to do. He emphasized the importance of ranking your profile and upgrading it to increase your chances of getting a freelance job. However, I think it's important to note that getting a freelance job is not as easy as it may seem. Despite following all the advice and tips, the competition is tough, and it's not easy to even get an interview, let alone land a job. Therefore, while freelancing can be a path to consider for the future as software engineers, it's important to be aware of the challenges and keep working hard to improve our skills and stand out from the competition.

After the speakers' presentations, a Q&A session was held where attendees asked many questions to the speakers, and they provided satisfactory answers. Attendees were also given the contact information of the speakers to get in touch with them later. [Pr. Abderrahim CHALFAOUAT](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abderrahimchalfaouat/), the host of the event, also gave a closing word, concluding the conference.

Overall, the Diversifying Horizons Second Edition was an engaging and informative event that provided engineering students with valuable insights into various career paths and possibilities. The expert speakers demonstrated their passion and knowledge in their respective fields, and attendees gained a better understanding of the opportunities available to them after graduation. The event was well organized, and the organizers should be commended for their efforts.
